## 🌟 The Main USP: No More Portal Fatigue
Checking attendance at LNMIIT shouldn't be a chore.
- **The Problem:** The official portal requires repeated logins and is not mobile-optimized, forcing students to scroll horizontally and vertically just to check a single percentage.
- **Our Solution:** Log in once and stay logged in. See your entire attendance dashboard instantly on a clean, mobile-first UI. No more horizontal scrolling or manual logins every time.

## 🔐 Security & Privacy (The "Digital Safe" Model)

We take student data privacy very seriously:
- **In-Memory Encryption:** Your portal password is never stored in plain text. It is encrypted using **AES-256** before being saved.
- **Safe Decryption:** Decryption only happens in the device's volatile memory (RAM) during active sessions to fetch data, ensuring your actual password is never exposed.
- **Local Control:** All sensitive processing stays on your device; we do not share credentials with any third-party servers.
